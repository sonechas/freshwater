            <h2 class="mt-4">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Highdorn Co Ltd is part of the Freshwater Group of Companies.</p>
            <p>The Freshwater Group is committed to protecting your personal data which has been collected to deliver the contract and services we have mutually agreed upon. This Privacy Statement should be read in alignment with our Data Protection Policy Statement.</p>
            <p>The Freshwater Group takes protecting your personal data very seriously and takes all reasonable steps to ensure your information is secure.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">What information we collect and how we use it</h2>
            <p>We record the personal and contact details you wish to give us, such as your name, address, email address, telephone numbers and/or contact details together with any other information we need to record a valid contract with you. We use this information to carry out the contract and services we have mutually agreed upon.</p>
            <p>We may need your financial details, such as bank details and other information pertaining to references and credit checks originally obtained. We use this information to receive payments from you or make payments to you.</p>
            <p>For employees, pension scheme members and suppliers we collect tax reference details. This enables us to deduct the relevant amount of tax from payments made to you and pay this amount on to the relevant tax authorities.</p>
            <p>In addition for employees, employee applicants and pension scheme members we retain personal employment information such as references, next of kin and emergency contact details, job titles and qualifications, attendance records and grievance procedures.</p>
            <p>At certain of our buildings we record CCTV images. This assists us in protecting our tenants and our buildings.</p>
            <p>When we make individual charitable donations we record certain special categories of personal data. These include beneficiary personal details, religious beliefs and health details. We record these details so we can demonstrate our stated registered charity aims are being met.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">When & how we share personal data</h2>
            <p>We will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so. The Freshwater Group will make sure that any person or company with whom data is shared will comply with our Data Protection Policy Statement.</p>
            <p>We may have to transfer details between locations in The Freshwater Group but all information is only visible to Freshwater Staff who are governed by privacy codes and training.</p>
            <p>We use third parties to support us in providing our services, for example managing agents, outsource service providers and property contractors who will have access to your personal information where necessary. We also use third party organisations to provide services to us and who may require access to certain personal data. These service providing organisations include IT providers, security and storage facilities, which includes cloud software located in secure data centres, valuers, finance providers as well as other professional advisors. We ensure any third party who has access to personal data we hold complies with our Data Protection Policy Statement.</p>
            <p>We do occasionally receive requests from law enforcement authorities, regulatory agencies, local authorities, utility companies or other government authorities with authority to obtain information. We will only provide personal data in accordance with the law, where necessary.</p>
            <p>We do not share your information with other agencies and we will not sell your information to third parties.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">How we will store your personal data</h2>
            <p>We will retain your personal data while we are undertaking the contract and services agreed and we will retain it after the completion of the contract and services in order to enable us to fulfil other legal requests or resolve disputes as they arise. The exact period we will keep each category of personal data is set out in our Retention of Records and Disposal Policy.</p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">Your rights to review and amend your data</h2>
